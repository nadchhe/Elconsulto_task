# Arabic Distress Detection Chatbot
This project implements an AI-driven chatbot that classifies Arabic text messages as either Distressed or Non-Distressed. The chatbot uses Arabic BERT (from Hugging Face) to extract text embeddings and a machine learning classifier to predict emotional states based on short Arabic messages.

The goal is to provide culturally sensitive mental health support by detecting potential distress signals in user messages. The chatbot can be used in real-time through a Gradio interface for quick and accessible predictions.
